2009-08-01: DOS editions of MW2 are now installed into DosBox,
            and DOS and Titanium Trilogy games can be started from MechVM
            => Mercs lässt sich aus MechVM nicht starten, in MechVM's DosBox
               ebenfalls nicht, aber von der DosBox auf Laufwerk C:
               (Sim schreibt SYS_CDNOTFOUND o.ä.)
            => 31stcc-dos funktioniert nicht
            => campain*.xml versucht immer, die Simulation über DosBox zu starten,
               auch wenn das Programm für native Ausführung eingerichtet wurde

Changed MechWarriorIIPRJ, Database_MW2 and MechWarrior3ZBD to
be subclasses of a new class MWArchive. Many interactions with these
classes now use the generic MWArchive, making it possible to use the
PRJ explorer with the *.MW2 and *.ZBD files. File Extraction now uses
a single algorithm for all archive types and supports creation of a 
report file for all archive types, which was previously possible only with
PRJ files.
