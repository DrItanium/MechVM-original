Far MultiArc plugin script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

U can now use Far to browse IS cabinets and do some basic operations.


There are some limitations of course :
--------------------------------------
- MultiArc cannot add files to a subdir inside an archive, so u have
  to work around by adding whole directories to the root of a cabinet,
  which is a list of File Groups;

- u cannot create File Groups;

- u cannot create CABs, period;

- i5comp will not extract empty directories by design

- I'll think of some more and add them here in the next version ;)


Some tips and pointers:
-----------------------
- to replace files, first create (or extract) the filegroup directory
  and place all new files in there, then delete the corresponding files
  from the CAB, and after that add the entire filegroup dir to the root
  of the CAB

- if u add a file to the cabinet and a file with this name/path already
  exists - it will *NOT* be replaced, instead u will get yet another copy
  of this file in a CAB

- do not try adding single files to the root of the CAB - it won't work ;)


To install the script:
----------------------
- edit the file <FarRoot>\Plugins\MultiArc\Formats\custom.ini

- append the script (found at the bottom of this humble manual) to that
  file, changing X in [TypeX] to the next available number

- save the file


That's it !
U can change TypeName field to whatever u want but 'InstallShield'
and u can extend the "nnnnnn..." placeholder if/when needed.


Script follows:
---------------

[TypeX]
TypeName=InstallShield5
ID=49 53 63 28
Extension=CAB
List=i5comp l -o -f
Format0="tt-dd-yyyy hh:mm zzzzzzzzz aaaa ppppppppp      nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
